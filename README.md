## How To

### Change signature

I'm creating this signature on my Gmail.
1. Open Gmail.
2. In the top right, click Settings Settings ‚öôÔ∏è > **See all settings**
3. Copy the signature from the browser
4. In the "Signature" section, paste the signature in the text box. 
5. At the bottom of the page, click Save Changes.

### Change svg colors
In order to change the color of the icons, you must open their file and edit the field "fill" on the tag "path":
```svg
<svg width="24" height="25" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
    <path d="..." fill="#03989E" /> <!-- Change this to whatever color you want -->
</svg>
    

```

## üêû Troubleshooting
I had some problems copyign and pasting the email signature, because it was adding underlines on the link tags.  
To solve that, I had to login to Gmail on another browser, open the email signature from there and paste it.

> Tried on Opera GX and Edge, didn't work. Worked only on Mozilla Firefox.
